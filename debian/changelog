          * Sipe can now retrieve calendar data (Meeting schedule/subject/

            OCS2007/LCS2005 as availability information.
          * Example: "Calendar: Currently Busy. Free at 11:30".
          * Team members (contacts with access level Team) will be able to see
            information about our current meeting (subject & location) (OCS2007)

          * Though Domino integration can work without any additional settings 
            in account configuration (on Windows), there are options to manually
            provide Domino Services URL and email address/password if it's
            different from SIP URI/Password settings on Basic tab.
